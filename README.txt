Mass Delete Discord DM script for Autokey Linux (not the Autokey for Windows !)
================================================================================

This is based on another script for Autokey Windows.
Autokey for Windows does not obviously have a version for Linux so i did the same for Autokey/autokey.

This allows you to mass delete messages in DMs, servers, and groups.
Note that you'll need to scroll up after some time so Discord can load the messages above.

Free free to edit it the way you want.
Either way, this is going to be much faster than doing it manually.
